# Exercise 1
## Set Up Your Dev Environment

The seed project relies on [node](http://nodejs.org/), [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/),
[git](http://git-scm.com/), and [bower](http://bower.io/) to manage dependencies and the build
process. This exercise will guide you through the installation of these tools. If you have
already installed these tools, you can [skip to exercise #2](#/exercises/2).

### Install node (and NPM)

Node allows you to run Javascript on the server and comes bundled with the node package manager
(NPM). You can check if you have node and NPM installed by opening a command prompt or terminal and
typing:
 
    node --version && npm --version

If you do not have node installed, navigate to the [download](http://nodejs.org/download) page and
download and run the appropriate installer.
